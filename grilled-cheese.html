	<h1>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>
	<p>A grilled cheese sandwich is the ultimate comfort food. It's simple to make and always hits the spot, whether you're enjoying it for lunch, dinner, or a midnight snack. All you need is some bread, cheese, and a little bit of butter.</p>
	<p>To make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich, start by heating a skillet over medium heat. Butter one side of each slice of bread, and place one slice, butter side down, in the skillet. Add a few slices of your favorite cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, or mozzarella, on top of the bread. Top with the other slice of bread, butter side up.</p>
	<p>Cook the sandwich for a few minutes on each side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted. Serve the sandwich hot, with a side of soup or a green salad for a complete meal.</p>
